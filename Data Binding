One-way Data Binding - 
When we create a variable inside the component (ts class) and use that variable to display a value on the html file using 
string interpolation, it is known as one-way data binding. 
Here the value of shown on the webpage is same as the value of the variable
in the component.
Eg: {{ var1 }}

Two-way Data Binding - 
In case of a form, we need to link the form input fields such that the form input is linked to the component variable as well as
the component variable value can be updated when we update the input field in the form directly. This is called two-way data binding.
Eg: [(ngModel)]="val1"
We define val1 in the component file. Now whenever the val1 value is updated from the html file, it can be accessed in the component 
ts file as well.
