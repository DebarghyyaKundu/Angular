In angular to separate environments and to use environment specific config/constant file we use the command : 
ng generate environments OR ng g environments

This is important because in this file we can store all the configs and constants that are going to be used throughout the project.

This creates a folder environments in our project along with 2 files: environment.development.ts & environment.ts
The development.ts is used for storing development environment related constants and configs while the environment.ts is used for prod.

By default angular would pickup the production config file, so we manually need to run ng serve --configuration=development
to tell angular to pick the environment.development.ts file instead.
