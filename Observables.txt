Observables in Angular are a way to handle asynchronous data streams. They are provided by the RxJS library and are 
commonly used for handling HTTP requests, user input events, and more.

In Angular, observables are often used with services like HttpClient to fetch data asynchronously.

Eg: If we have a API that is being called using HttpClient library. We would call the API using an instance of HttpClient and the 
respectie Http verb (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE) and value returned would be of type 'Observable'. 
We can then subscribe the Observable to get the value once the async operations is complete using callbacks. 

Observable concept is similar to how Promises work in JS.

import { Observable } from 'rxjs';

// Calling Observable
getValue(): Observable<MyClass> {
    return httpClient.get<MyClass>('api_url');
}

// Subscribe to the observable
getValue().subscribe(res => console.log(res));

// Output:
sample object
