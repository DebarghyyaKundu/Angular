Ngrx state management lifecycle:

SELECTOR   <----   STORE            DATABASE

                      ^                ^
                      |                |
|                    
|                   REDUCER         SERVICE
|
V                     ^                ^
                      |                |

COMPONENT   ---->    ACTION   <--->   EFFECTS


Store: 
Holds the application state (immutable - cannot be changed directly). It can only be changed by using reducers (functions) which change
the state value.

Actions:
Events that modify the state in the store.
For eg: When the service calls the DB to fetch data, an event/action - "Data fetched successfully" can be triggered.
This action can is used to trigger the call of the respective reducer to update the state value.

Reducers: 
Functions that take actions and modify the state, based on the action type.

Effects:
Handles async operations (like fetching data from a server) and then triggers new actions.
For eg: Triggers the action "Data fetched successfully" when the data is fetched from DB successfully.


This state management lifecycle has 2 flows:

Flow 1: 
1. 'Action' is dispatched from 'Component'.
2. This action is then processed by the 'Reducer'.
3. This reducer will then update the state in the 'Store' as per the action.
4. This changed data state can now be selected by the 'Selector' to update the actual 'Component'

Flow 2 (In case async operation is executed to load data via DB):
1. Action is dispatched to load data which is passed to effects.
2. Data is loaded via this action from the DB and another action is dispatched via the 'Effects'.
3. The new action (eg. data loaded successfully) is processed by the 'Reducer'.
4. This reducer will then update the state in the 'Store' as per the action.
5. This changed data state can now be selected by the 'Selector' to update the actual 'Component'
