Angular supports two types of Form Validations:

1. Reactive Form Validations - 
Validation is done by accessing the form fields in the component file.

Steps: 
i. In the template you need to declare a form holding formGroup.
This reservationForm variable is actually an instance of 'FormGroup' that has been created in the corresponding component class.
Eg: <form [formGroup]="reservationForm" (ngSubmit)="onSubmit()"> ... </form>

ii. The formControlName attribute is very important for each of the inputs. It is required to access those input fields in the 
reservation-form component so that reactive validation can be done to these fields.

iii. The formBuilder instance needs to be added in the constructor of the component so that it is accessible when the component is initialized.
Angular dependency injection provides us with the object of the formBuilder if we add it in the constructor directly. 
We donot need to create an object and maintain it manually.
Eg: constructor(private formBuilder: FormBuilder) {}

iv. In the component class we need to add validation the input fields. Since this needs to happen as soon as the component is initialized,
the validation logic is added in ngOnInit function.
Eg:   ngOnInit() {
        this.reservationForm = this.formBuilder.group({
        checkInDate: ['', Validators.required],
        guestEmail: ['', [Validators.required, Validators.email]],
        ...
        });
    }
The key names of the formBuilder.group has to exactly match the formControlName in the HTML template so that Angular can link them.

2. Template Driven Form Validation - 
Validation is done directly in html template.
